cd roofing-estimator
click on index.html

4. Usage
Once the installation is complete, run the following command to start the Roofing Estimator:

bash
Copy code
This will launch the application.
5. Autodetection of Roof Area
The autodetection feature leverages advanced algorithms to analyze Mapbox maps and identify roof areas automatically. Users can simply input the address or location, and the tool will generate an estimate based on the roof layout visible on the map.

To use autodetection:

Input the address or location in the designated field.
Click on the "Autodetect" button.
The tool will analyze the Mapbox map and display the estimated roof area.
6. Drawing Polygons and Calculating Area
For cases where autodetection might not be sufficient or for more precise measurements, the tool allows users to manually draw polygons on the map. The area enclosed by the drawn polygon will be calculated instantly.

To draw polygons:

Click on the "Draw" button.
Use the cursor to click on the map and create vertices for the polygon.
Double-click to close the polygon.
The tool will calculate the area enclosed by the polygon.
7. Integration with Mapbox
The Roofing Estimator seamlessly integrates with Mapbox, a leading mapping platform. This integration enhances the user experience by providing detailed and interactive maps for better visualization of roof structures. Users can take advantage of Mapbox's features such as satellite imagery, street maps, and custom styling options.

To integrate with Mapbox:

Sign up for a Mapbox account and obtain an API key.
Navigate to the application settings.
Enter your Mapbox API key in the designated field.
